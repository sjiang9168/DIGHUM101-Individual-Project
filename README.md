# DIGHUM101: Practicing the Digital Humanities Projects

This was a picture I took in Japan last year. All the neon boards give it a "digital" feel but the abundance of humans firmly grounds it in "humanity." 

## Group Project Abstract:
  While digital humanities strive to combine the computational prowess of STEM with the powerful literary analysis of the humanities, there are areas within the field preventing it from achieving its full potential. In our presentation, “the Importance of Inclusivity in the Digital Humanities” we dive into the diversity issues plaguing the field, through the use of three articles: “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” by Kim Gallon, “Why I Dig: Feminist Approaches to Text Analysis” by Lisa Marie Rhody, and “All the Digital Humanities are White, All Nerds Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave” by Moya Z. Bailey. Each of these authors present a compelling case for inclusivity that ultimately share a similar thread: minorities can think and analyze in ways the traditional digital humanists cannot. Feminist perspectives offer nuance when it comes to stop words, Black scholars can use their unique strengths to analyze how humanity is defined by systems of power, and moving minorities to the center of the digital humanities table is crucial for growth are all arguments these authors make. The tough love Dr. Nan Z Da gives in “The Digital Humanities Debacle” only further drives home the following point: if the digital humanities need to change, and Gallon, Rhody, and Bailey have already given significant evidence for the benefits of inclusivity, why not start with incorporating minorities? The field would only prosper in these conditions. Furthermore, I have already personally experienced the benefits of working with a diverse cast in the duration of this project. Each person on this team was able to bring unique strength to the group. Vinnie was great at thinking on his feet and answering questions, while Jackie’s calm and matter of fact work ethic greatly facilitated a smooth work flow. I was able to contribute the rhetorical analysis skills I learned in Professor Anderson’s DIGHUM 100 course when it came to examining the essay. Thus, this further emphasizes the importance of diversity – if the entire group had the same training and background, it would be much harder to find unique talents to make the group as a whole more robust and versatile. 
  
## Individual Project Abstract: 
   A comment about the Billboard Hot 100 on DIGHUM 100’s Piazza thread was the start of this project. In it, the poster theorized there wouldn’t be common music themes because artists write through in-spiration and are inspired by different objects. Intuitively, I thought this couldn’t be the case. From my perspective, while humans do indeed write music through inspiration, there must be some common universal human experiences leading to very similar muses for these artists. Thus, I decided to investi-gate this issue myself, using a text corpus from the Library of Congress titled America Singing: Nine-teenth Century Song Sheets, because in addition to looking for themes, I also wanted to examine that if these themes did indeed exist, whether or not they would be recognized and relatable to a person of today. Initially, there were four themes I predicted: song lyrics related to happiness and sadness, gov-ernment propaganda, and alcohol. After conducting topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the overwhelming amount of words related to happiness, sadness, and patriotism gave signifi-cant evidence to the first three themes. However, there was an astonishing lack of song sheets related to alcohol (I only found 5 out of over 4000), even after I attempted to account for the possible tem-poral terminology difference by using popular phrases for alcohol from a newspaper publication from 1901. This was somewhat unexpected as alcohol should have been rampant given the fact clean drink-ing water was generally unavailable at this time, and that the Library of Congress explicitly mentioned alcohol related song sheets in its introduction for the collection. However, I did notice a term ‘john’ in the LDA topics – this may have been an allusion to alcohol, though further research is needed to dif-ferentiate whether that is the case or this really was just a proper noun. Whatever it may be, the ge-otagging results showed these song sheets mostly followed the population distribution of America, suggesting the ubiquitous popularity of these songs. Thus, all these results reinforced the notion hu-mans have comparable experiences, leading to similar themes within songs and mass relatability among the population when released. Furthermore, these concepts (happiness, sadness, and patriot-ism) remain recognizable through time, allowing us to be connected through a universal human experience.
